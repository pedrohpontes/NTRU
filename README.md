# NTRU cryptosystem
A Java library for NTRU random key generation, encryption and decryption.

This is an implementation of the NTRU cryptosystem in the language of convolution polynomials.
There is no user interface right now, only the definitions and methods.
This implementation is intended for educational purposes, and should not be used in any significant way.

# Description
NTRUkeygen/encrypt/decrypt.java: key generation, encryption and decryption libraries.

ConvPoly.java: convolution polynomial definitions and methods used in NTRU.

Poly.java: polynomial definitions and methods used in ConvPoly.java.

Mod.java: some arithmetic functions used in NTRU.

EncDecTest.java: an example of usage to encrypt and decrypt a message.

The 'main' methods offer an example of usage but no user interface.

# Reference
All the algorithms are based on the following textbook:
Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, Joseph H. Silverman, An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography. Springer, 2008.

#Feedback
The author is a beginner in coding, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
